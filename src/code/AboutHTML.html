		<h2>Text Document Analyzer</h2>
		<p>The Text Document Analyzer was developed in the Fall semester by Group 4 for their CMSC 495 Capstone Experience course at UMGC. Team members included:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Laura McBride (Project Manager)</li>
			<li>Jason Howarth (Test Manager)</li>
			<li>John McGuire (Technical Writer and Requirements Manager)</li>
			<li>Noah Gray (Software Developer)</li>
			<li>Daniel Nester (Software Developer)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The software was designed to parse literary documents and collect quantitative metrics that would be useful for literary analysis. Development took place over 8 weeks.</p>
