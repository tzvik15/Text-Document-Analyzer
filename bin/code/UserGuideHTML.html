		<h2>TEXT DOCUMENT ANALYZER USER GUIDE</h2>
		<p>The Text Document Analyzer is a stand alone application for parsing literary documents and extracting statistical and mathematical metrics from the written work. Extracted data is stored in an integrated database so that it may be recalled at the user's convenience. Data records can be added to the database, deleted from the database, or displayed using the GUI's menus and controls.</p>
		<h3>1.1 DATABASE RECORD</h3>
		<p>Records in the database consist of metadata entered by the user and metrics generated when a document is parsed by the application. Each record correlates to a single literary document that has been parsed by the application. Records can be added and deleted by the user through the use of the application's menu system.</p>
		<p>Metadata fields stored in a record include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Author</strong> - the author of the document</li>
			<li><strong>Title</strong> - the title of the document</li>
			<li><strong>Year published</strong> - the year the document was published</li>
			<li><strong>Era</strong> - the era, BCE or ACE, the document was written</li>
			<li><strong>Genre</strong> - the genre of the document</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Metrics fields stored in a record include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Word Count</strong> - number of words</li>
			<li><strong>Punctuation Count</strong> - number of punctuation marks</li>
			<li><strong>Sentence Count</strong> - number of sentences</li>
			<li><strong>Syllable Count</strong> - number of syllables</li>
			<li><strong>Distinct Word Count</strong> - number of unique words</li>
			<li><strong>Average Word Length</strong> - average number of letters in a word</li>
			<li><strong>Average Words Per Sentence</strong> - average number of words in a sentence</li>
			<li><strong>Average Syllables Per Word</strong> - average number of syllables in a word</li>
			<li><strong>Distinct Words List</strong> - a list of unique words and their frequency</li>
			<li><strong>Distinct Punctuation List</strong> - a list of unique punctuation marks and their frequency</li>
			<li><strong>Flesch Reading Ease Score</strong> - a score relating the the reading level of the document
				<ul>
					<li><strong>90-100:</strong> Very easy to read</li>
					<li><strong> 80-90:</strong> Easy to read</li>
					<li><strong> 70-80:</strong> Fairly easy to read</li>
					<li><strong> 60-70:</strong> Plain English</li>
					<li><strong> 50-60:</strong> Fairly difficult to read</li>
					<li><strong> 30-50:</strong> Difficult to read</li>
					<li><strong> 10-30:</strong> Very difficult to read</li>
					<li><strong>  0-10:</strong> Extremely difficult to read</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>1.2 HOW TO: UPLOAD TEXT DOCUMENT FOR ANALYSIS</h3>
		<p>Uploading a text document for analysis can be done using the applications menu system and input components. Documents uploaded will be parsed by the application for metrics and all calculated data will be stored in the application database.</p>
		<p>Note: Author, Title, Era, and Genre are required. Publish Year may be blank.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Select <strong>File > Add Entry</strong> from the application's top menu. A new window will appear where you may browse for a file and enter metadata about the document.</li>
			<li>Enter the Title, Author, Publish Year, Era, and Genre.</li>
			<li>Click the <strong>Browse</strong> button.</li>
			<li>Locate and select the document you would like to parse.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>OK.</strong></li>
			<li>Click the <strong>Parse</strong> button.</li>
			<li>A dialog box will appear to confirm the document has been parsed.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>1.3 HOW TO: DELETE AN ENTRY FROM THE DATABASE</h3>
		<p>Deleting an entry from the database can be done using the application's top menu. Entries must be deleted one at a time. Entries deleted from the database cannot be recovered and must be recreated by reparsing the original text document.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Select <strong>File > Delete Entry</strong> from the application's menu.</li>
			<li>Use the dropdown menu to select the document record you would like to delete. To delete all records at once, select the <strong>DELETE ALL RECORDS</strong> option.</li>
			<li>Select the <strong>Delete</strong> button.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm that the record(s) should be deleted, or <strong>No</strong> to cancel.</li>
			<li>A dialog box will appear to confirm the document has been deleted or preserved.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>1.4 HOW TO: VIEW ANALYZED DOCUMENT'S METRICS</h3>
		<p>After parsing a text document, data can be retrieved from the database and displayed in the application's display panel. All metadata and metrics stored in the document's database record will be displayed.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Use the dropdown menu to select the document you would like to view.</li>
			<li>Click the <strong>Display</strong> button.</li>
			<li>The metrics will appear in the display panel at the bottom of the window.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>1.5 HOW TO: QUERY THE DATABASE</h3>
		<p>The Text Document Analyzer can also be used to perform more advanced queries on the literary data stored in the database. Though this information is not stored in a single database record, the application can aggregate data from multiple records sharing a common field. For example, using the Query Database window a user can ask for the average word count of all records where the author is Edgar Allan Poe.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Click <strong>File > Query Database</strong> in the application's top menu.</li>
			<li>Use the dropdown menus and the textbox to construct your query.</li>
			<li>Click the <strong>Display</strong> button.</li>
			<li>The results will appear in the display panel at the bottom of the window.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>VIEW</strong> - Statistical and mathematical values such as Average, Total, Min, and Max can be selected using the VIEW dropdown menu.</p>
		<p><strong>OF</strong> - Metrics such as Word Count and Flesch Reading Ease Score can be selected using the OF dropdown.</p>
		<p><strong>WHERE</strong> - Criteria such as Author or Genre can be selected using the WHERE dropdown.</p>
		<p><strong>EQUALS</strong> - The EQUALS text field allows the user to enter a custom value corresponding to the WHERE dropdown option, such as the value "Edgar Allan Poe" for the Author option or "Comedy" for the Genre option.</p>
		<h3>1.6 HOW TO: SEARCH FOR DISTINCT WORDS</h3>
		<p>Once a document has been parsed, The Text Document Analyzer stores a list of every distinct word used in the document, as well as how many times each word was used. The Search Distinct Words window can be used to view this information. This functionality can be used to determine how many times the word "love" appears in Shakespeare's play "Much Ado About Nothing".</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Select <strong>File > Search Distinct Words</strong> from the application's top menu.</li>
			<li>Use the dropdown menu to select a record to search.</li>
			<li>Enter a word to search for into the textfield, or enter * to view a list of all distinct words.</li>
			<li>Click the <strong>Display</strong> button.</li>
			<li>The results will appear in the display panel at the bottom of the window.</li>
		</ol>
